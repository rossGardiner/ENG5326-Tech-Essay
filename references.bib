abstract="The history of modern-day surgery was an revolution in recognizing the need to advance surgical techniques and platforms. It stems from the realization that optimizing a surgeon's operative capability can enhance a patient's care and outcome. It originated from basic diagnostic laparoscopy to more simple operative laparoscopic surgery, followed by the invention and introduction of video-assisted surgery by Camran Nezhat M.D. and subsequent robotic assistance. This chapter details the key advancements of many individuals and their accomplishments in shaping modern-day surgery. There were pivotal moments that were built upon concepts of their predecessors. However, it was ingenuity and revolutionary thinking beyond the standard of the times to create new frontiers in enhancing surgery and patient care.",

abstract = {Abstract Background Compared with conventional minimally invasive surgery and open surgery, robotic-assisted minimally invasive surgery can overcome or eliminate drawbacks caused by operator restrictions, motion limitation by the trocar and the image system, such as fatigue, trembling, low precision, constrained degree-of-freedom, poor hand–eye coordination and restricted surgical vision. In this paper, a novel partly tendon-driven master–slave robot system is proposed to assist minimally invasive surgery and a master–slave control architecture is developed for abdominal surgical operations. Methods A novel master–slave surgery robot system named MicroHand A has been developed. A kinematic analysis of master and slave manipulators was conducted, based on screw theory and vector loop equation. The relationships of the tendon-driven multi-DOF surgical instrument among Cartesian space, actuator space and joint space were derived for control purposes. The control system architecture of the MicroHand A was designed with intuitive motion control and motion scaling control. Llewellyn's absolute stability criterion and the transparency of the one-DOF master–slave system are also analysed. Results Intuitive motion control under dissimilar kinematics in master–slave manipulations and motion scaling control were accomplished to solve absonant hand–eye coordination, kinematic dissimilarity and workspace mismatch of master–slave manipulator problems. A series of tests and animal experiments were carried out to evaluate system performance. The experimental results demonstrate that the system could accomplish intuitive motion control and motion scaling control, and that the control system is stable and reliable. Conclusions The experiments performed on the MicroHand A robotic system yielded expected control results. The system satisfies the requirements of minimally invasive surgery. Intuitive motion control and motion scaling control under different kinematics for the master and slave have been implemented. Copyright © 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

               colectomy for cancer remain debatable. The multicentre COLOR
               (COlon cancer Laparoscopic or Open Resection) trial was done to
               assess the safety and benefit of laparoscopic resection compared
               with open resection for curative treatment of patients with
               cancer of the right or left colon. METHODS: 627 patients were
               randomly assigned to laparoscopic surgery and 621 patients to
               open surgery. The primary endpoint was cancer-free survival 3
               years after surgery. Secondary outcomes were short-term
               morbidity and mortality, number of positive resection margins,
               local recurrence, port-site or wound-site recurrence,
               metastasis, overall survival, and blood loss during surgery.
               Analysis was by intention to treat. Here, clinical
               characteristics, operative findings, and postoperative outcome
               are reported. FINDINGS: Patients assigned laparoscopic resection
               had less blood loss compared with those assigned open resection
               (median 100 mL [range 0-2700] vs 175 mL [0-2000], p<0.0001),
               although laparoscopic surgery lasted 30 min longer than did open
               surgery (p<0.0001). Conversion to open surgery was needed for 91
               (17\%) patients undergoing the laparoscopic procedure.
               Radicality of resection as assessed by number of removed lymph
               nodes and length of resected oral and aboral bowel did not
               differ between groups. Laparoscopic colectomy was associated
               with earlier recovery of bowel function (p<0.0001), need for
               fewer analgesics, and with a shorter hospital stay (p<0.0001)

It is well recognised that the performance of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) imposes an increasing burden on surgeons’ manual dexterity and visuomotor control. Tissue deformation, restricted workspace, and a limited field-of-view make manual operation of the procedure difficult. With the advent of robot assisted MIS, manual dexterity is enhanced by microprocessor controlled mechanical wrists, allowing motion scaling and tremor removal. Further enhancement of three-dimensional (3D) vision and intra-operative image guidance permits improved clinical uptake of the technology, ensuring better operative safety and consistency. This chapter provides a detailed overview of robotic surgical systems and introduces recent developments in the integration of synergistic controls such as virtual fixtures, dynamic active constraints, and perceptual docking.}

    abstract = { Background. Combining the strengths of surgical robotics and minimally invasive surgery (MIS) holds the potential to revolutionize surgical interventions. The MIS advantages for the patients are obvious, but the use of instrumentation suitable for MIS often translates in limiting the surgeon capabilities (eg, reduction of dexterity and maneuverability and demanding navigation around organs). To overcome these shortcomings, the application of soft robotics technologies and approaches can be beneficial. The use of devices based on soft materials is already demonstrating several advantages in all the exploitation areas where dexterity and safe interaction are needed. In this article, the authors demonstrate that soft robotics can be synergistically used with traditional rigid tools to improve the robotic system capabilities and without affecting the usability of the robotic platform. Materials and Methods. A bioinspired soft manipulator equipped with a miniaturized camera has been integrated with the Endoscopic Camera Manipulator arm of the da Vinci Research Kit both from hardware and software viewpoints. Usability of the integrated system has been evaluated with nonexpert users through a standard protocol to highlight difficulties in controlling the soft manipulator. Results and Conclusion. This is the first time that an endoscopic tool based on soft materials has been integrated into a surgical robot. The soft endoscopic camera can be easily operated through the da Vinci Research Kit master console, thus increasing the workspace and the dexterity, and without limiting intuitive and friendly use. }

               equipment are utilized to remove the section of bone, which is
               called the bone flap. The bone flap is temporarily removed, held
               at the surgical instrument table, and then placed back after the
               brain surgery has concluded. In some cases, depending on the
               etiology and indication for the procedure, the bone can be
               discarded, stored in the abdominal subcutaneous space, or
               cryopreserved under cold storage conditions. If the bone flap is
               discarded or not placed back into the skull during the same
               operation, the procedure is called a craniectomy. In a
               decompressive craniectomy used for the treatment of malignant
               brain edema, the bone flap is placed back a few weeks after the
               brain swelling has improved. The surgical procedure to
               reconstruct and place the bone flap back into the skull during a
               second intervention is known as cranioplasty. From a historical
               context and perspective, cranial interventions varied from a
               single burr hole trephine to a larger craniectomy. Modern
               craniotomies are performed by connecting a series of burr holes.
               Although trephination is the oldest cranial surgical technique
               with ancient reports dating back to 2300 years, our current
               modern surgical technique for a craniotomy is the final cured
               result of the procedure introduced at the end of the 19th
               century by the self-educated surgeon Wilhelm Wagner. Although it
               was much later in the course of history that the transition from
               trephination to a tailored resection via craniotomy happened,
               ancient civilizations, such as the Incas in Peru, must have had
