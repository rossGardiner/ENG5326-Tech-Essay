# ENG5326-Tech-Essay
Technical essay completed as part of ENG5326 - Robotics M at the University of Glasgow. This work, titled "Review of Recent Advancements in RMIS Using dVRK" comprises a literature review of surgical robotics for minimally invasive surgery. Empasis is given to the da Vinci surgical system and the dVRK research platform. 

## Abstract: 
Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has been shown to reduce patient trauma and accelerate recovery.
Problems arising from the complex interface required by MIS are addressed with robotically assisted surgery.
The clear market leading device for robotically assisted surgery is the da Vinci system from Intuitive Surgical.
Additional input from the research community has enabled development of the da Vinci Research Kit
(dVRK) - a comprehensive platform used in a wide range of recent research papers. In this report, recent
advancements for robotically-assisted MIS (RMIS) are explored. This includes novel tooling mechanisms
which integrate with the dVRK and enable new types of surgical procedures. Further, a review is given on
some automation strategies for subordinate surgical tasks. This work showcases the research enabled
by the dVRK and contributes some ideas for future developments using the platform
