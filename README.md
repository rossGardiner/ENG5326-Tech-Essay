# ENG5326-Tech-Essay
Technical essay completed as part of ENG5326 - Robotics M at the University of Glasgow. This work, titled "Review of Recent Advancements in RMIS Using dVRK" comprises a literature review of surgical robotics for minimally invasive surgery. Empasis is given to the da Vinci surgical system and the dVRK research platform. 

## Abstract: 
Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has been shown to reduce patient trauma and accelerate recovery compared with open surgery. Robotic MIS (RMIS) adds dexterity, surgeon comfort and facilitates higher degrees of precision. The clear market leading device for robotic surgery is the da Vinci system from Intuitive Surgical and additional input from the research community has enabled development of the widely used da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK). In this report, recent advancements for RMIS are explored. This includes novel tooling mechanisms which integrate with the dVRK and a review on automation strategies for subordinate surgical tasks. This work showcases the research enabled by the dVRK and contributes some ideas for future developments using the platform.
